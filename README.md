Fitnesse is a uat tool where in we write the commands in the table format and set up the FIT framework in the back end, we give the input in typically formatted interpretted input. Fitnesse will then generatethe test scripts using FIT frame work in the backend.now we write commands as wiki and then it runs the scripts and give us the results.
